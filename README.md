Hey, Iâ€™m Brian.

Iâ€™m a product designer, podcaster, and writer, currently living in San Francisco. Right now Iâ€™m building native mobile apps at GitHub. Letâ€™s grab a coffee.

### Figma plugins
Thereâ€™s a lot of work in the design process that is boring, tedious, and repetitive. I like to make plugins to help automate it away.
